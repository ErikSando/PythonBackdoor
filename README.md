# PythonBackdoor
 A TCP and UDP python backdoor that allows remote command execution. My router doesn't allow port forwarding, so I have not tested it over different networks. I have only tested it with my own computer communicating to itself over my home network.
 The TCP version is unfinished and has major bugs, the UDP version has been *lightly* tested and experienced no bugs.
